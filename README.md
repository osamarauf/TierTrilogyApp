# TierTrilogyApp
TierTrilogyApp is a 3-tier web application that seamlessly integrates Flask (both for Frontend & Backend), and Nginx to create a robust and scalable web experience. The backend, powered by Python Flask, receives user input and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. The frontend provides an interactive interface to capture user data, and Nginx serves as a reverse proxy.
